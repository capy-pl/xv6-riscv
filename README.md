Please chek the [original xv6-risv repo](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) for the acknowledgements  
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.
